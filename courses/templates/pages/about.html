  OYGo: About
{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
  <p>OYGo is a web grading system built by Sam Gralla.  Students grade their own work according to a rubric, and a grader reviews it.  This helps students take an active role in assessing weaknesses, which builds strength.  OYGo: own your growth!
  <p>This is the very first version of OYGo.  It's not too snazzy but it works.  (And if it doesn't, email me!)</p>
